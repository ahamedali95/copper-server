#JAVA - THIS IT IT! LEARN IT!

###Introduction

- Java is invented by Sun Microsystems by James Gosling in 1995. Today, Oracle owns Sun.
- Java programs written in the Java language are compiled in to Java bytecode which then is executed by the JVM.
- Java is a statically typed types of variables are known at compile-time rather than runtime.
This allows you to strictly define the structure and data types of the code you write.
- Has class-based OOP model
- Java SDK = Java Standard Api tools + Java compiler + Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which includes the JVM
- Java has 3 different set of APIs:
    1. Java Standard Edition(JSE) - For developing desktop and standalone server applications
    2. Java Enterprise Edition(JEE) - For developing web applications that run embedded in a Java server
    3. Java Micro Edition(JME) - For developing mobile applications
- Apache Software Foundation - a nonprofit organization looking out for number of open source projects that
are built or being built to benefit the Java ecosystem. 
    
### Data Types 

1. boolean - true or false
2. short - 16 bit signed value, values from -32,768 to 32,767
3. int - 32 bit signed value, values from - 2,147,483,648 (-2^31) to 2,147,483,647 (2^31)
4. long - 64 bit signed value, values from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808(-2^63) to 9,223,372,036,854,775,808(2^63)
5. float - 32 bit floating point value, i.e., 123.2232323f - 6 or 7 precision. Note: we have to append `f` to make the value a float.
6. double - 64 bit floating point value, i.e., 101.1234567891234567
7. char - 16 bit unicode character, values from '\u0000' (or 0) to '\uffff' (or 65,535)
